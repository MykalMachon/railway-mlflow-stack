# Deploy and Host MLFlow on Railway

MLflow is an open-source platform for managing ML/AI lifecycles. It handles experiment tracking, model packaging, and deployment with a combination of online services and local Python tooling. MLFlow standardizes workflows across tools and frameworks, making collaboration, reproducibility, and scaling ML systems easier in both research and production environments.

## About Hosting MLFlow

Hosting MLFlow on Railway is easy! This tempalte makes it a 1-click deploy. Once all the service's are deployed and reporting healthy, you'll just need to configure your local environment using the username/password automatically generate for you by Railway and you're good to start building production ready ML/AI systems!

### Implementation Details

#### Authentication via Caddy

MLFlow has a few experimental authentication features right now, but nothing stable.

By using basic authentication via Caddy, we're following MLFlow's best practice on deploying a production system behind a reverse proxy and using a stable and reliable form of authentication that their Python tooling already supports.

#### Extending the default dockerfile

The default dockerfile provided by mlflow just includes the bare minimum setup.  

By creating a custom dockerfile that extends the default image, and following the best practices outlined on the MLFlow docsite, We were able to make this template a 1-click-deploy and ensure that it would still be heavily extensible to suit your needs after deployment.

## Why Deploy MLFlow on Railway?

<!-- Recommended: Keep this section as shown below -->
Railway is a singular platform to deploy your infrastructure stack. Railway will host your infrastructure so you don't have to deal with configuration, while allowing you to vertically and horizontally scale it.

By deploying MLFlow on Railway, you are one step closer to supporting a complete full-stack application with minimal burden. Host your servers, databases, AI agents, and more on Railway.
