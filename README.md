# Railway MLFlow Stack

a complete [MLFlow](https://mlflow.org/) stack setup to run via [Railway](https://railway.com). 

## Resources 

This project was started due to this [MLFlow bounty](https://station.railway.com/questions/template-request-m-lflow-c7d942b1) put out by the Railway team. 

- [Deploy Guide for a MLFlow Server](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/ml/tracking/tutorials/remote-server/): should be a good starter for building this out on Railway.
